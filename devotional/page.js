      <h2>Scripture</h2>
      <p><strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</p>

      <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Faith calls us to trust God beyond what we can see or understand.
        In moments of uncertainty, faith becomes our anchor. This week,
        meditate on trusting God’s promises even when circumstances appear
        unclear. Let your faith shape your perspective and strengthen your walk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout this week, return to this reflection and allow the Word
        to deepen your confidence in God's plan for your life.
