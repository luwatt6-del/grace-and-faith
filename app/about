      <h1>About Grace & Faith Ministries</h1>

      <p>
        Grace & Faith Ministries is a Christ-centered ministry dedicated to
        spreading the Gospel, strengthening faith, and restoring hope through
        the power of God’s Word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to glorify God by equipping believers, reaching the lost,
        and building a community grounded in grace, faith, and truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that lives are transformed through prayer, teaching, service,
        and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
