      <h2>This Week's Theme: Faith</h2>
      <p>
        Faith is trusting God even when we cannot see the full picture. 
        It is believing in His promises and standing firm in His Word.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scripture:</strong> "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, 
        the evidence of things not seen." – Hebrews 11:1
      </p>

      <h2>Grace</h2>
      <p>
        Grace is God's unearned favor toward us. It reminds us that we are saved 
        not by works, but by His love and mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scripture:</strong> "For by grace you have been saved through faith." – Ephesians 2:8
      </p>

      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Hope anchors our soul during difficult seasons. It gives us confidence 
        that God is working all things together for good.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scripture:</strong> "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace." – Romans 15:13
