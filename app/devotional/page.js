      <h3>Scripture for the Week</h3>

      <p>
        “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, 
        the evidence of things not seen.” – Hebrews 11:1
      </p>

      <p>
        “For we walk by faith, not by sight.” – 2 Corinthians 5:7
      </p>

      <hr style={{ margin: "40px 0" }} />

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Faith is not pretending everything is fine.  
        It is choosing to trust God even when life feels uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        There may be areas in your life where clarity is missing — 
        decisions that feel heavy, prayers that feel unanswered, 
        seasons that feel unclear. Faith gently reminds us that 
        God is present even when we cannot see the full picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        This week, allow yourself to rest in the truth that 
        you do not have to have everything figured out. 
        Faith is not about having all the answers — 
        it is about trusting the One who does.
      </p>

      <h3>Prayer for the Week</h3>

      <p>
        Father God,
      </p>

      <p>
        Strengthen my faith in moments of uncertainty.  
        Help me to trust You beyond what I see.  
        Quiet my fears and remind me that You are working 
        even when I do not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teach me to walk by faith and not by sight.  
        Renew my confidence in Your promises.  
        Let Your peace guard my heart this week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amen.
      </p>
